We collaborated with the UCT Consulting Club for the 2022 Case Competition. Entering this competition gave prospective/aspiring consultants the chance to work in teams on a realistic case under the mentorship of consultants. The case theme is based on one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

We hoped that our member's exposure to frameworks of Effective Altruism could provide a significant comparative advantage and that this competition would give our members a great opportunity to try to apply these frameworks to a practical case study.

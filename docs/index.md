## Effective Altruism is about doing good better.
Effective altruism is a philosophy and global social movement focused on answering one question: How can we best help others?
Our resources are limited, so we have to use them wisely.

### Effective Altruism UCT is a local chapter of this movement dedicated to discussing and engaging with this idea.
We host discussion groups, speaker events and panels.
We collaborate with local and international non-profit organasitions.
We write and publish content discussing and promoting EA ideas.

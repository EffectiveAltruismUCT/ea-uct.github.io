Effective altruism (EA) is a philosophy and global social movement focused on answering one question: How can we best help others?

Our resources are limited, so we have to use them wisely.

### EA UCT is a local chapter of this movement dedicated to discussing and engaging with this idea.
We host discussion groups, speaker events and panels.

We collaborate with local and international non-profit organasitions.

We write and publish content discussing and promoting EA ideas.

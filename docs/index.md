## Effective Altruism is about doing good better.
Effective altruism is a philosophy and global social movement focused on answering one question: How can we best help others? Our resources are limited, so we have to use them wisely.

### Effective Altruism UCT is a local chapter of this movement dedicated to discussing and engaging with this idea.

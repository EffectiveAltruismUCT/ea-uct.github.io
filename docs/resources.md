## Inspiring Stories from the Effective Altruism Movement

### Julia Wise and Jeff Kaufman: Living on Less, Giving More
Julia Wise and Jeff Kaufman are a testament to personal sacrifice for the greater good. Their decision to live on a fraction of their income to donate the majority to effective charities showcases the profound impact personal commitments can have.

### Dr. Toby Ord: A Lifetime Commitment
The story of Dr. Toby Ord, founder of "Giving What We Can," exemplifies how individual decisions to prioritize altruism can inspire global movements, challenging us to reconsider our lives and the causes which we prioritise. Some ways of spending our lives are thousands of times better for others and thinking about this can lead us to helpful conclusions. See [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org/) for more.

### The Against Malaria Foundation: Saving Lives with Simplicity
The work of the Against Malaria Foundation demonstrates how targeted, evidence-based interventions like providing insecticidal nets can prevent suffering and death on a massive scale, embodying the core principles of Effective Altruism.
